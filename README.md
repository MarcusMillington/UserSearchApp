# User Search App

This is an app with a search box. After 2 characters are entered an api will be called to lookup a list people with either a firstname or lastname that starts with the search text entered. The names of the matched people will be displayed below the search box. Any of the matched people can be selected and their full details will be added to the screen.

New people can be added to the system. To do this, click the 'New User +' button, to display the create user form. Fill in all the details and click 'Create'. The newly created user will now be available in the search.
